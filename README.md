## Name to Usernames Convertion Rules
### Table of rules for generating usernames:  

{f} = first letter of Name, {fi} = first two letters of Name ...  
{l} = first letter of Lastname, {la} = first two letters of Lastname ...  

**The rules can be automatically aplied to the reversed version of the full name as well, by using [-a].**
